# Manish_OrderProcessingSystem

This is a simplified Order Processing System for an e-commerce application built with .NET Core. It provides functionality for managing customers, products, and orders, with an emphasis on creating orders and calculating total prices based on associated products.

## Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 5+ SDK]
- [SQL Server]
- [Entity Framework Core CLI]

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash

## Assumptions or Design Decisions
Database Relations:
Each Customer can have multiple Orders.
Each Order can contain multiple Products.

Order Fulfillment Check:
New orders can only be placed if the customerâ€™s previous order is fulfilled (IsFulfilled set to true).

Total Price Calculation:
The total price of an order is calculated based on the sum of the prices of associated Product items.

## Additional Notes for Reviewers
Logging:
This project uses Serilog for logging API requests and errors to the console.
Logs are helpful in tracking requests and diagnosing validation or database issues.

Data Validation:
Basic validation is implemented to ensure valid data is passed to endpoints (e.g., existing customerId and valid productIds for orders).
